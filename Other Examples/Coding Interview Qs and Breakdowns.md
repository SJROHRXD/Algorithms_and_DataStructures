# Big O Coding Interview Questions and Breakdowns

## Q / Prompt: "How to identify which asymptotic upper bound is more efficient - categories of these things?"

When comparing the efficiency of algorithms using asymptotic upper bounds, there are several categories of functions that are commonly used to describe the growth rate of the algorithm's running time as the input size increases. These categories, in order from fastest-growing to slowest-growing, are:

- O(1) - constant time: the running time of the algorithm is independent of the input size.
- O(log n) - logarithmic time: the running time of the algorithm increases logarithmically with the input size.
- O(n) - linear time: the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size.
- O(n log n) - linearithmic time: the running time of the algorithm increases as the product of the input size and its logarithm.
- O(n^c) - polynomial time: the running time of the algorithm increases as a power of the input size (where c is a constant).
- O(c^n) - exponential time: the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially with the input size (where c is a constant).

When comparing two algorithms using these categories, we look at their asymptotic upper bounds and compare their rates of growth. In general, an algorithm with a faster-growing upper bound will be more efficient for larger input sizes.

For example, if we have two algorithms with upper bounds of O(n^2) and O(n log n), the second algorithm will be more efficient for larger input sizes. This is because, as the input size increases, the difference in growth rates between n^2 and n log n becomes increasingly pronounced.

However, it's important to note that these upper bounds only describe the rate of growth of the algorithms, and not their actual running time. Actual running times can depend on many factors, including the specific implementation, hardware, and input data. So while asymptotic upper bounds are a useful tool for comparing the efficiency of algorithms, they should be used with caution and supplemented with actual measurements of running time in real-world scenarios.

## Q / Prompt: "Can you give me examples of coding interview questions relating to this?"

Here are some examples of coding interview questions that relate to asymptotic upper bounds:

1.  What is the time complexity of the following algorithm, and what is its Big O notation?

            function findMax(arr) {
                let max = arr[0];
                for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
                    if (arr[i] > max) {
                    max = arr[i];
                    }
                }
                return max;
            }

2.  Implement an algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. What is the time complexity of your algorithm, and what is its Big O notation?

3.  Given two arrays of integers, write a function to find the common elements between them. What is the time complexity of your function, and what is its Big O notation?

4.  Implement an algorithm to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array of integers. What is the time complexity of your algorithm, and what is its Big O notation?

5.  Write a function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. What is the time complexity of your function, and what is its Big O notation?

In each of these questions, it's important to not only provide the correct answer, but also to explain your reasoning and justify your choice of algorithm and data structures based on their time complexity and efficiency.

## Q / Prompt: "How would I solve this problem?"

> The time complexity of the findMax function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr. This is because the function iterates over each element of the array once to find the maximum value, and the number of iterations is directly proportional to the length of the array.

To solve this problem, the findMax function iterates over the input array, keeping track of the current maximum value encountered. The function starts by assuming that the first element of the array is the maximum value, and then iterates over the remaining elements of the array. For each element, it checks whether it is greater than the current maximum, and updates the maximum if necessary. Once all elements have been checked, the function returns the maximum value.

Here's an example of how to use the findMax function:

            const arr = [5, 10, 3, 8, 1];
            const max = findMax(arr);
            console.log(max); // Output: 10

In this example, the findMax function is called with the array [5, 10, 3, 8, 1], and it returns the value 10, which is the largest element in the array.

## Q / Prompt: "How do I know that the time complexity is O(n), is this because we are working with an array? Or is this because of how the findMax function is written?"

> The time complexity of the findMax function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr. This is because the function iterates over each element of the array once to find the maximum value, and the number of iterations is directly proportional to the length of the array.

The time complexity of the findMax function is O(n) because it is directly proportional to the length of the input array arr, which is represented by the variable n. This is because the function iterates over each element of the array once to find the maximum value.

The time complexity of an algorithm is determined by the number of operations required to execute the algorithm, as a function of the input size. In this case, the number of operations required by the findMax function is proportional to the length of the input array, since it needs to examine each element of the array exactly once to find the maximum value.

So, if the length of the input array is doubled, the number of operations required by the findMax function will also double. This is why the time complexity of the findMax function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

It is not because we are working with an array **_in general_**, but specifically because of how the findMax function is written, and how it interacts with the array. For example, if we had an array and the function only accessed a single element of the array, the time complexity would be constant, or O(1), because the number of operations required would not depend on the size of the array.

## Q / Prompt: "What if we were working with an object, instead of an array, would that change the time complexity?"

Yes, if we were working with an object instead of an array, the time complexity of the findMax function would be different. This is because the way that the function interacts with an object would be different from how it interacts with an array.

In particular, the findMax function is designed to iterate over an ordered collection of values, such as an array, to find the maximum value. Objects, on the other hand, are unordered collections of key-value pairs. To find the maximum value in an object, we would need to iterate over all the values in the object and compare them to each other to determine which one is the largest.

The time complexity of this process would depend on how the object is structured, and how we choose to iterate over its values. In general, if we have an object with n key-value pairs, the time complexity of finding the maximum value would be at least O(n), since we would need to examine each value in the object at least once to determine the maximum.

**However, the time complexity could be higher than O(n) if we have a nested object or a complex data structure.** In these cases, finding the maximum value may require more complex operations, and the time complexity could be higher.

## Q / Prompt: "Can you break down how I would approach solving this problem for a coding interview?"

> Implement an algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. What is the time complexity of your algorithm, and what is its Big O notation?

Sure! Here's an approach to solving the problem of sorting an array of integers in ascending order:

Choose a sorting algorithm: There are many different algorithms for sorting arrays, each with different time complexities and trade-offs. Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort. In a coding interview, it's important to choose an algorithm that you're familiar with and that has a good time complexity. Merge sort and quicksort are both good choices, as they have an average time complexity of O(n log n), which is better than the O(n^2) time complexity of bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

Implement the chosen algorithm: Once you've chosen an algorithm, you'll need to implement it in code. There are many resources online that provide sample code for common sorting algorithms, and you can use these as a starting point. It's important to test your code thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly for a variety of inputs.

Analyze the time complexity: After you've implemented your sorting algorithm, you'll need to analyze its time complexity. This involves looking at the number of operations required to sort an array of size n, and expressing this as a function of n. For example, if your sorting algorithm requires n^2 operations to sort an array of size n, its time complexity would be O(n^2). It's important to understand the time complexity of your algorithm, as this can have important implications for its performance in practice.

Optimize if necessary: If the time complexity of your algorithm is not optimal, you may need to optimize it to improve its performance. There are many different techniques for optimizing sorting algorithms, such as using parallelization, optimizing memory usage, or choosing a different algorithm. However, in a coding interview, you may not have time to implement complex optimizations, so it's important to choose an algorithm that has a good time complexity to begin with.

Overall, the approach to solving the problem of sorting an array of integers in ascending order involves choosing a good sorting algorithm, implementing it in code, analyzing its time complexity, and optimizing it if necessary. By following these steps, you can come up with an efficient and effective solution to this problem in a coding interview.
