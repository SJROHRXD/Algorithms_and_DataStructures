# The Big O of Objects

## Objects

- Unordered data structures
- Stored in key-value pairs
- Work well when you don't need order
- Work well when you need fast access / insertion and removal

## Object Performance

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(1)

- Objects are very fast

- Add, Store New, Retreive, Update, Remove all in constant time âœ¨
- There's no "beginning, end, middle" just a key (is data flat? lol?)
- There is no "order"
- Accessing information with a key is / constant time /

- Searching, O(N), is / linear time /
- Searching is not "looking for a key, for example, first name"
- Searching IS "checking to see if a given piece of information is IN A VALUE"
- "Is it on the right side of the colon?"

- We could potentially have to check every single item property in the object

- As number of properties of the object grows, as "N" grows, the length of time it takes to search for a value grows

## Object Methods

## Method Performance

- Object.keys - O (N)
- Object.values - O (N)
- Object.entries - O (N)
- hasOwnProperty - O (1)
