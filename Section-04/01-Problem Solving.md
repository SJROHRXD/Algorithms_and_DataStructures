# Problem Solving

## Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

- What are the steps to make the tough challenges solvable?

## Objectives:

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns, including frequency counters, two pointer problems, and divide and conquer

## What is an Algorithm?

- A process or set of steps used to accomplish a task

- Calculate the first 100 prime numbers
- Instagram's algo to show results in chronological order vs. whatever it is now

- We need to know this because everything we do in programming requires us to solve problems and consider performance

- And because it comes up in interviews lol

1. Devise a plan
2. Master common problem solving patterns

- Break problems down into categories
- Identify categories, use recipes
