- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?
- What does the solution look like? What should be returned?

### Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum // Answer the aforementioned questions

- Can I restate the problem in my own words:
- Write a function, that takes in two numbers, add them, and return the result or the sum

- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?

- Floating points, how large, integers, upper bound?
- Are there limits, are there negatives, are they whole?
- Strings? Types?

- Are we always going to be working with two numbers?

- What does the solution look like? What should be returned?
- In what format will we return the sum? Will we round?

- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
- Do we have enough information? Yes, in this case. But what if only one number is passed in? Do we return "null" or "undefined" etc???

- How should I label the pieces of / data / that are part of this problem? What terminology should I use?
- Function name
- Num1, Num2 as arguments
- Return Sum
